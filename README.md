# How to build
To build this repo you just need the dotnet sdk installed as F# is shipped per default with it.
However for developing the code and testing it out I recommend to place this repository to the `$YOUR_GAME_DIRECTORY/mods/repos/THIS_REPOSITORY`.
With that placement the release build is automatically placed at the right location (will be placed at `$YOUR_GAME_DIRECTORY/Content/FactoryGenerator`).
